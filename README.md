## Communication Component
This package contains all the C++ files run on the Arduino Mega and Python scripts run on the Raspberry Pi. The Python interfaces used to interface with the prediction models are also included, as are noteworthy model versions.

- `arduino.cpp`: the C++ program run on the Arduino Mega
- `client.py`: the final script run on the Raspberry Pi
- `local_client.py`: testing script that does not perform TCP communication with the server
- `dataScript.py`: script used for collecting sensor readings and writing it to a CSV file for model training
